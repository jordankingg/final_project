Your site must be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data
All data must be stored in a database accessed through the MySQLi or PDO interface.
You should have an access wall that users need to log in to get through.  There are then two main sections to your site
Outside the Wall:
Log in page
Users should be able to sign up for an account by providing an email address and creating a password.  An email will be sent allowing the user to activate their account.
An option to reset their password if forgotten.  An email will be sent to the user.
Inside the Wall:
Pages that enter, update, select, delete data
Change their password
Log out
If a user enters the URL for a page inside the wall and they have not logged in yet, they should be redirected to the log in page.
If they are inside the wall, but have been inactive for a period of time and try to navigate to a new page, they should be logged out and returned to the log in page.
Page is constructed using valid HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
Pages pass validation and are accessible.
